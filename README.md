# NeuroWheelX - A Smart Wheelchair

## Overview
NeuroWheelX is a smart wheelchair designed to enhance mobility and safety for users. It integrates advanced **fall detection, health tracking, and obstacle avoidance** to assist individuals with disabilities or mobility impairments. The system leverages **IoT sensors, embedded systems, and real-time monitoring** to ensure a safer and more efficient wheelchair experience.

## Features
- üöë **Fall Detection**: Detects falls and sends alerts along with GPS location updates.
- üè• **Health Tracking**: Monitors key health metrics like heart rate and body temperature.
- üöß **Obstacle Avoidance**: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and prevent collisions.
- üì° **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications via a mobile app for emergency assistance.
- ‚öô **Adaptive Energy System**: Optimizes energy consumption for extended battery life.
- üì± **Mobile App Integration**: Provides a user-friendly interface to access alerts and wheelchair status.
